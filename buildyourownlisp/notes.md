* Here are some descriptions and examples of some of the built in types:
	- void	Empty Type	
	-	char	Single Character/Byte	char last_initial = 'H';
	-	int	Integer	int age = 23;
	-	long	Integer that can hold larger values	long age_of_universe = 13798000000;
	-	float	Decimal Number	float liters_per_pint = 0.568f;
	-	double	Decimal Number with more precision	double speed_of_swallow = 0.01072896;

* cc -std=c99 -Wall
* for debugging the errors there is some tool like: **Valgrind**, **gdb**.

* Inside a conditional statement's parentheses any value that is not 0 will evaluate to true. This is important to remember as many conditions use this to check things implicitly.
