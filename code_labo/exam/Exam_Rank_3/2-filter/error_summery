The error in your code likely stems from incorrect handling of string manipulation and pointer operations. Here's a breakdown of the key
issues and what you need to understand about C:

---

### **Key Issues in Your Code**
1. **Incorrect String Replacement Logic**:
   - You're using `strstr` in a loop to find and replace the substring, but modifying the string after each replacement causes subsequent
searches to fail. For example, replacing "ab" with "**" in "abab" would result in "**ab", and the next search for "ab" would miss the second
occurrence.

2. **Printing the Wrong Buffer**:
   - After modifying `copy`, you're printing `buff` instead of `copy`. This means the output reflects the original input, not the modified
version.

3. **Pointer Mismanagement**:
   - The `result` pointer is being incremented and modified in a loop, but the string is being altered during the process, leading to
undefined behavior.

4. **Infinite Loop Without Proper Termination**:
   - The `while (1)` loop runs indefinitely unless `total_read` is 0 (EOF) or a newline is detected. However, the logic for detecting EOF or
newline is flawed.

### **What You Need to Know About C**
1. **Arrays vs. Pointers**:
   - **Arrays**: Fixed-size, contiguous memory blocks. Their size is known at compile time (e.g., `char arr[10];`). You cannot reassign an
array to point to a new location.
   - **Pointers**: Variables that hold memory addresses. They can point to any valid memory location (e.g., `char *ptr;`). Pointers do not
have a fixed size and require manual memory management.
   - **Decay**: When used in expressions, arrays decay into pointers to their first element (e.g., `arr` becomes `&arr[0]`).

2. **String Manipulation**:
   - Use `strcpy`, `strncpy`, or `memcpy` to copy strings. Be cautious with buffer overflows.
   - `strstr` searches for a substring, but it does not modify the string. You need to manually replace characters after finding matches.

3. **Memory and Pointers**:
   - Always ensure pointers point to valid memory before dereferencing them.
   - Avoid modifying strings while searching for substrings, as this can lead to incorrect results.

4. **EOF Handling**:
   - `read(0, buff, 10)` reads from stdin. A return value of 0 indicates EOF. You should handle this gracefully to avoid infinite loops.

### **Task to Improve Your Knowledge**
**Goal**: Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a given substring with asterisks (`*`) in a string, while preserving the original
input until all replacements are done.

**Steps**:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Accept a command-line argument for the substring to replace.
   - Read input from standard input line by line.

2. **String Replacement**:
   - For each line of input:
     - Copy the line into a buffer.
     - Search for all occurrences of the substring.
     - Replace each occurrence with `*` (e.g., replace "ab" with "**").
     - Print the modified line.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle overlapping substrings (e.g., replace "aa" in "aaaa" â†’ "**aa").
   - Ensure the original string is not modified until all replacements are complete.
   - Handle empty input or invalid command-line arguments.

**Example**:
- Input: `replace "ab" "abab"`
- Output: `**ab`

**Hints**:
- Use `strstr` to find matches, then `strcpy` or `memcpy` to replace characters.
- Use a temporary buffer to store the modified string.
- Avoid modifying the original string while searching for substrings.

This task will help you master pointer arithmetic, string manipulation, and proper memory management in C.
