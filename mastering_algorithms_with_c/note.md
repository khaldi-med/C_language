## Mastering Algorithms with C --Book-- 

* Three reasons for using data structures are: **efficiency, abstraction, and reusability.**

* In computing, some of the most common organizations are **linked lists, stacks, queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs.**

*  In C, we make a data structure store data of any type by using void pointers to the data rather than by maintaining private copies of the data in the data structure itself.

* A void pointer (void \*) is a type of pointer that can point to any data type. Since it doesn't have a specific type, it can be used to store addresses of any kind of data.

* As with data structures, three reasons for using formal algorithms are **efficiency, abstraction, and reusability.**
