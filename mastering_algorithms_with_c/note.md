## Mastering Algorithms with C --Book-- 

* Three reasons for using data structures are: **efficiency, abstraction, and reusability.**

* In computing, some of the most common organizations are **linked lists, stacks, queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs.**

*  In C, we make a data structure store data of any type by using void pointers to the data rather than by maintaining private copies of the data in the data structure itself.

* A void pointer (void \*) is a type of pointer that can point to any data type. Since it doesn't have a specific type, it can be used to store addresses of any kind of data.

* As with data structures, three reasons for using formal algorithms are **efficiency, abstraction, and reusability.**

* **Modularity:** in computing and programming refers to dividing a system into separate modules or components. Each module handles a specific functionality and operates independently. 

* Readability

* Simplicity

* Consistency

### Pointer Manipulation

* **Generic pointers and casts:**
    - Mechanisms that bypass and override Câ€™s type system.**Generic pointers** let us point to data without being concerned with its type for the moment. **Casts** allow us to override the type of a variable temporarily.

* **Function pointers:**
    - Pointers that point to executable code, or blocks of information needed to invoke executable code, instead of pointing to data. They are used to store and manage functions as if they were pieces of data.
